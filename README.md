Dispersive amplitudes for hadron spectroscopy. 

In particular the repository contains an implementation of rescattering corrections for the 3pi system. Following the method deveoped by Brehm: PRD23(1981)1194

The code desparately needs documentation! 

## Build
Needs ROOT and cmake
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Brehm rescattering amplitudes
run `testRescat` form the `build/bin` directoy
